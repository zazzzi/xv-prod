            XV Production was born out of XV Atelier in 2018.
            <br></br>
            The goal was to offer local design- and production services for
            other fashion- and textile brands.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            XV Production is a creative studio that wants to act freely and meet
            the customer exactly where they are in the production process. We
            believe in a circular textile industry that acts closely to the
            consumer. It is no secret that the fashion industry is polished on
            the surface, and that other much less glamorous sides exist.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Through being a local actor that work exclusively with in-house
            production, we offer our customers a close and transparent
            relationship. Our customers are more than welcome to work
            collaboratively together with us in our 425 square meter studio in
            Bor√•s.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            As a result, both the communication and work can be done in a rapid
            phase, and we are able to jointly develop ideas and/or prototypes.
